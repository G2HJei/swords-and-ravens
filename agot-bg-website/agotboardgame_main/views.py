            <p>
                These past few months have seen the introduction of 2 major features to <b>Swords
                and Ravens</b>: the Dance of Dragons expansion (courtesy of mmasztalerczuk and Gereon), and
                the Vassal feature from Mother of Dragons (courtesy of Gereon). You can now
                create a game and toggle these features to test them out! Remember though that they are still
                in Beta, and that bugs might still happen.
            </p>
            <p>
                This month also marks the 1-year anniversary of S&R! More than 1400 games have been played up until now,
                and the platform draws around active 300 players every day. ðŸŽ‰<br/>
            </p>
            <p>
                If you've monitored the activity of the GitHub repository, you might have noticed that
                I, Longwelwind, have not actively contributed to the project for a few months now. Indeed, while I greatly
                enjoyed coding S&R at first, my time and my motivation for the project diminished over time, and I'm
                now at a point where I'd like to move on to other projects. I've handed the keys to the kingdoms
                (i.e. admin rights to the production server) to Gereon, who has been
                contributing to the project since its beginning and to whom we can thank for
                all the recent additions to the platform.
            </p>
            <p>
                As for me, I'm not done with online board games! I've learned a lot while developping S&R,
                and I'm currently experimenting on <b>Ravens</b>, a library that would allow
                anyone with coding skills to develop their own online-multiplayer board game. While it's still
                in the prototype phase at the moment, I hope I'll have a working beta for those who are interested.

                <b>Swords and Ravens</b> launched 2 months ago, and a lot of things have happened since then.
                1416 users registered and more than 500 games have been played to completion!
            </p>

            <p>
                The game also evolved a lot since launch: variants for games with less than 6 players have
                appeared, a forum has been added to discuss everything about the game, a lot of UI improvements
                were made and a ton of bugs have been squashed. Around 800 commits were made on the codebase,
                available on <a href="https://github.com/Longwelwind/swords-and-ravens">GitHub</a>, some of
                them done by <a href="https://github.com/Longwelwind/swords-and-ravens/graphs/contributors">external
                contributors</a>. All the changes done can be found
                in <a href="https://community.swordsandravens.net/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=7">the changelog</a>.

            <p>
                The <a href="https://community.swordsandravens.net">forum</a> has been launched, to discuss
                everything related to the game and the development of Swords and Ravens, don't hesitate to check
                it out!
            </p>

            <p>
                It's not over, obviously. The Vassals mechanic, which appeared in the MoD extension, is
                progressing and will be playable in the coming months. Multiple other meta-game features such
                as abuse reports, player statistics and localization are also planned, and should be available
                once I find the time to work on them. ðŸ˜›
            </p>

            <p>
                Thanks to all the players who made this possible, and I hope S&R will allow many more games to
                be played!
